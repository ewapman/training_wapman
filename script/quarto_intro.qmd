## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1


```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Level 1 header

This is plain text

## Level 2 header

-   asterisk for bulleted list

    -   indented bullet

1.  numbered list
2.  numbered list

More plain text *italics* or *italics*

**bold** or **bold**

```{r important r code}

```

```{r}
x <- 1 + 2
```

My important result is `r x` (this is an in-line code chunk) or another `r 6*7`
If you want text to look like code `this is code formatted`

```{r}
height_ft <- c(5.2, 6.0, 5.7)
coef <- 3.14
```
